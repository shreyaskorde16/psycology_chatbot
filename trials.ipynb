       " 'the two tests should be high on the positive side).\\nIn addition to reliability, we want to make sure the test measures what it says it measures. This is called\\nvalidity . Let’s say a new test is developed to measure symptoms of depression. It is compared against\\nan existing and proven test, such as the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI).  If the new test measures\\ndepression, then the scores on it should be highly comparable to the ones obtained by the BDI. This is',\n",
       " 'called concurrent or descriptive validity . We might even ask if an assessment tool looks valid. If we\\nanswer yes, then it has face validity, though it should be noted that this is not based on any statistical or\\nevidence-based method of assessing validity. An example would be a personality test that asks about\\nhow people behave in certain situations. Therefore, it seems to measure personality, or we have an\\noverall feeling that it measures what we expect it to measure.',\n",
